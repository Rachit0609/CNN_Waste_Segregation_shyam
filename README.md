# 🗑️ Waste Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements an AI-powered waste classification system using deep learning. It aims to automatically categorize waste images into distinct classes like Plastic, Metal, Cardboard, etc., to support smart recycling, efficient waste segregation, and environmental sustainability.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Improper waste disposal leads to environmental degradation and low recycling efficiency. Manual waste sorting is time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. This project uses CNNs to automate the waste classification process, enabling real-time sorting in recycling plants or smart bins.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and preprocess waste image data
- Visualize dataset and analyze class imbalance
- Build a CNN from scratch for multi-class image classification
- Apply data augmentation and class weighting techniques
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, F1-score
- Summarize insights and prepare the model for potential deployment

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images across **7 waste categories**:
- `Cardboard`
- `Food_Waste`
- `Glass`
- `Metal`
- `Other`
- `Paper`
- `Plastic`

All images were resized, encoded, and split into training, validation, and test sets.
